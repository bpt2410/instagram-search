          %h3 Wonolo Coding Challenge

          %h3 Background
          %p We are asking you to complete this Coding Challenge so that we can assess your level of experience and competence.

          %p Our objective is to make this Coding Challenge as realistic as possible in terms of:
          %ul
            %li the kind of work you’d be doing at Wonolo, and
            %li the way in which you would be doing it.

          %p So, please feel free to consult Google, StackOverflow, etc, just as you would if you worked at Wonolo.

          %h3 Output

          %p When you are complete, please send me two things:

          %ul
            %li the URL of the Github repo containing your code

            %li the URL of your app running on Heroku

          %p I will review both your code and the running application.

          %h3 The Challenge

          Create a Rails 4 website that allows the user to search for Instagram posts in a location

          specified by the user.

          %p The user should be able to:

          %p 1. Enter coordinates ­ latitude / longitude

          %p 2. Enter a search radius in kilometers

          %p 3. Hit Search

          %p 4. See a page showing a feed of the Instagram posts in specified location, ordered by

          distance (closest first)
          %p Paginate through the posts

          %h3 Rules

          %p Use Ruby 2.x and Rails 4.x
          %p Create specs with RSpec
          %p Use Git/Github and commit often with comments (I’m interested to see your commit history to understand how you approached the problem)
          %p Your app must be live on Heroku and must work
          %p Be creative
          %p Feel free to use any component, gem, etc that you feel helps or makes the application better

          %h3 Resources

          %a{:href => 'https://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/media/', :target=>'_blank'}https://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/media/

          %h3 Extra Credit
          %p Use Google Maps to visualize locations of posts
          %p Show Instagram pictures in a carousel UI
