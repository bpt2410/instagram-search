# instagram-search
# The Challenge

Create a Rails 4 website that allows the user to search for Instagram posts in a location specified by the user.

The user should be able to:

1. Enter coordinates ­ latitude / longitude

2. Enter a search radius in kilometers

3. Hit Search

4. See a page showing a feed of the Instagram posts in specified location, ordered by distance (closest first)

4. Paginate through the posts

# Rules

­ Use Ruby 2.x and Rails 4.x

­ Create specs with RSpec

­ Use Git/Github and commit often with comments (I’m interested to see your commit history to understand how you approached the problem)

­ Your app must be live on Heroku and must work

­ Be creative

­ Feel free to use any component, gem, etc that you feel helps or makes the application better
